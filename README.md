# CMSC 621 CLOCK, MULTICAST and COMMIT

## This project conntaines three miniprojects

1. Centralized Multi User Concurrent Bank Account Manager
2. Two Phase Commit protocol 
3. Clock Synchronization 


### Centralized Multi User Concurrent Bank Account Manager

Just run make file to compile and create executables.
1. It uses SPDLog concurrent logging library (https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
2. Uses Thread-Pool implementation for concurrency
3. Uses Apache AB tool to test concurrency and server KPI such as Requests Per Minutes etc.


### Clock Synchronization 

### how to compile the binaries:

1) run "make" to generate all binaries
2) or you can generate individual binaries by running "make Berkeley", "make Causal", "make NonCausal", "make DistributedME"
3) run "make clean" to delete all the binaries and object files


## Two Phase Commit protocol 

### how to run the programs:

I have provided Python script which allows you to run multiple instances of the same program without manual intervention.
You just need to pass command line argument to Python script specifying which executable you want to run

1) run "â€œ./helper.py berkeley" to execute Berkeley binary
2) run "./helper.py causal" to execute Causal binary
3) run "./helper.py noncausal" to execute NonCausal binary
4) run "./helper.py bonus" to execute Distributed Mutual Exclusion algorithm binary.
